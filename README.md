# Customer-Segmentation
This is the final project of the project series in the Machine Learning nano degree of Udacity.
In this project, I applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that I use has been provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.
